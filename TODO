Dear Emacs, this is -*- Org -*- mode.
#+title: TODO

* TODO =GET-SERVICE-META= should not go into an infinite loop if there's no network access.

* TODO User should be able to to toggle sand and prod environments.

  Design: instead of hard-coding a URL, let the user provide it in an
  environment variable.

* TODO Program should check whether sentinel file exists before querying it :bugs:

  This causes crashes.
