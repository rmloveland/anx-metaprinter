Dear Emacs, this is -*- Org -*- mode.
#+title: TODO

* TODO Figure out what email address should be in the history

  Once you have, update everything to that.

* TODO Output should include name of service or report

  E.g., at it should at least begin by printing something like
  "h1. Publisher".  It would probably be too annoying to code up all
  the naming special cases to do it properly.

* TODO Program should check whether sentinel file exists before querying it

  This causes crashes.

* TODO Don't print the stupid heap size message

  This is the one:

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  heap size 5000000 is too small, using 5198884
  #+END_QUOTE
