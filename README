ANX SCHEME HACKS

A.K.A., Scsh hacking for fun and profit.

Porting my Emacs Lisp code over to Scsh so that I can distribute
little command-line apps to coworkers. Ideally they'll only have to
type things like

    $ print-meta 'publisher'

to output pre-formatted tables for our wiki docs.

GETTING STARTED

First, create the directory ~/bin/metaprinter.

Then, create a file `auth' in that directory, which will hold your
JSON login credentials, e.g.,

{
    "auth": {
        "password": "FOOBAR",
        "username": "rloveland"
    }
}

After you save that file, change its permissions so no one else can read your password like so:

$ chmod 600 auth
